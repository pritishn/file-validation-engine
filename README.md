# File Validation Engine
This was created as our hackathon project for Dell Hack2Hire Challenge. 

Summary of problem statement : 
Design an app to facilitate text/csv file syntax-check and data-validation wrt to a backend database. The app should provide the user an interface to create flexible schemas to validate different kinds of text/csv files without having to hard-code the validation steps inside the program.

**Note : The firebase backend services responsible for deploying the whole app have been stopped. This app is no longer deployed anywhere.**
